                            <h2>Our Favorite Classic San Francisco Restaurants</h2>
                    
                                <p> Though San Francisco is a city focused on the next big new thing, it's also a place that clings tight to its history, packing its longest-standing restaurants even as buzzier, hotter places come and go.</p>

                                <p>For this list, some ground rules were established: Each spot must be a full restaurant (no bars or one-item spots like ice cream places or coffee shops), each must have opened before 2000, and each must offer something special (a significant bit of history, a spectacular view, or a standout dish, for example). In the end, there’s a classic San Francisco restaurant for every mood, ranging from seafood joints, diners, taquerias, clubby wood-paneled rooms, and anything else a lover of old-school dining could want.</p>

                                <figure>

                                </figure>

                                <p>As fall produce shuffles in at farmers’ markets — persimmons, chicories, squash, citrus — my cooking is becoming more practical and comforting. I’m drawn to simple stews, roasts and pots of beans like this one from Melissa Clark, which builds flavor with seaweed and simmered carrots, celery and fennel — and this vegan recipe from Sarah Digregorio, which uses miso, soy sauce and smoked paprika to approximate the more savory, smoky flavors of a pot of red beans and rice.
								
								<p> But between those one-pot meals, it’s fun to find time for one-off experiments. The other day, I tinkered with a vegetarian dish inspired by the classic roast chicken with bread salad that’s still on the menu at Zuni Café in San Francisco.</p>

								<p> Here’s what I imagined: little pieces of open-crumb bread, browned in olive oil; mixed with vinegar-soaked currants, toasted pine nuts and sautéed garlic and scallions; and soaked in hot pan juices. The bread, soggy in places but still crisp in others, would tangle with wispy salad greens in a little vinaigrette, and a big pile of crisp, brown mushrooms would nestle on top. Once I started imagining it, it became impossible not to cook it! </p>

								<p>If you want to try it, start by prepping Judy Rodgers’s classic bread salad. You can use the same pan to fry the bread in olive oil, toast the pine nuts and sauté the garlic and scallion. Then, instead of roasting a chicken, sear some mushrooms with olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper. For extra crisp mushrooms, try placing a heavy pot or pan on top to squish them — a life-changing tip I got from the writer Bettina Makalintal.</p>

                                <p>House of Prime Rib’s gold-accented, wooden front doors are still locked before dinner service on a recent Thursday afternoon, when a spry gentleman wearing a crisp blue and red patterned button-up and dark denim smiles from behind its glass windows. He unlocks the entrance and welcomes me inside the acclaimed restaurant that’s been known for its well-marbled cuts of prime rib and chilled martinis since 1949.</p>


								<p>“Prime rib is a comfort food. When the economy goes down, you don’t have the money to go for ‘experience food,’” he candidly said. “You want to go somewhere where you know you’ll get your money’s worth — and that’s what we are — and we stay that way.” </p>

								<p>Born in Bavaria, Betz began working in restaurants in Munich when he was 14 years old. Before he purchased HOPR in 1985 from its original owner, Lou Balaski, he waited tables at Hoffman’s Grill, a no-fuss diner and historic landmark at 619 Market St. between New Montgomery and 2nd streets. At just 28 years old, Betz ended up buying Hoffman’s in 1968 and became the city’s youngest restaurateur.</p>

                                </figure>

                                <p>Dim sum restaurants are everywhere in San Francisco. They line the streets of Chinatown, the Richmond, and the Sunset—but even with all this har gow and siu mai to choose from, Yank Sing is always the first place we think of when we’re in the mood for dumplings. This place has been around in one form or another since 1958, and while it may not be the best or most interesting dim sum spot in SF, it’s still a classic we love. Coming here feels like a special trip or a grand occasion that’s tough to get anywhere else in the city.</p>

                                <p>You can get a similar experience at either of Yank Sing’s two locations, but walking through the tall atrium of the one at the Rincon Center makes a weekday lunch feel like much more of an event. The dining room is always packed and it’s set up like a grand banquet hall with white tablecloths and servers in black bow ties—the whole scene makes you feel like you’ve been dropped into a wedding reception you didn’t know you were invited to. </p>

                                <p>There is a menu, but you don’t order from it. Instead, carts with cabbage salads and stacked towers of steaming hot dumplings to choose from whiz over to your table as soon as you’re seated. Even after the table is filled with more steamers, baskets, and bowls than you can handle, more and more food keeps coming, like planes landing at SFO but without the wind delays.</p>

                                <p>What gives Yank Sing real staying power—and why we think about this place so much—is its consistency. Their siu mai are always stuffed to the brim with shrimp, the potstickers are juicy 100% of the time, and every time we get the green beans, they’re perfectly spicy. Still, it’s not all created equal. There are standout dishes you need to order no matter what, like the build-your-own Peking duck buns that come with tender meat with crispy skin, and soup dumplings with delicate wrappers and rich filling.</p>

                                <p>
                                   We regularly get asked about the best brand new restaurants in San Francisco, as well as about the all-time classics. But what about the places that are slammed for six months, until everyone decides to move onto the next shiny new thing? Many of these places are still absolutely fantastic, and they shouldn’t be forgotten like the original Aunt Vivian from The Fresh Prince.
