                                    When’s the last time you had a meal at Ju-Ni that came out to less than $75? We’d bet $75 and our most prized monstera that the answer is never. But if you want the same high-quality fish for about half the cost of that beloved NoPa spot’s omakase ($220 at the time of writing), head to their casual sister restaurant, Handroll Project. The Mission spot specializing in temaki is fun and laidback—and you won’t have to shell out a week’s worth of rent to get here.
