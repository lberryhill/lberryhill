                    <h2> Our Story </h2>

                
                        <p>We started Scoops! in a yellow truck on the streets of SLO in 2018 with a mission to make good ice cream that makes you feel good. </p>

                        <p>Nowadays, people can spend so much time on what’s “healthy” they don’t stop to consider what’s healthy. As far as we’re concerned, happiness is healthiness. </p>

                        <p>What could be happier than that magic combination of milk, cream, eggs, and cane sugar (or coconuts, cashews and oats for our vegan friends)? Yes, our ice cream has fat. And that’s okay. It’s good-good, not good-bad. </p>

                    <h2> Our Beliefs </h2>

                        <p>Good is choice ingredients. Even if we have to go to Mount Etna to get them. </p>

                        <p>Good is simple ingredients. If it’s tough to pronounce, it’s probably tough to digest. </p>

                        <p>Good is harmonious ingredients. We seek to satisfy omnivores and vegans alike. </p>

                        <p>This is our way. The good way. The Scoops! way. Not just the best way to make ice cream, but to live. </p>
