            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Scoops! </p>
            
            <p>My ice cream shop, scoops! Is a small ice cream business with a brick and mortar store in downtown San Luis Obispo.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience of my site is people who like ice cream and want to learn about which flavors are stocked this week. Their primary task is to learn about the flavor offerings and where the store is located. Some users visit the site to learn more about the company and its mission. Although most just visit to find information vital to their ice cream eating experience.</p>

                    <p>    
                        We started Scoops! in a yellow truck on the streets of SLO in 2018 with a mission to make good ice cream that makes you feel good. </p>

                        <p>Nowadays, people can spend so much time on what’s “healthy” they don’t stop to consider what’s healthy. As far as we’re concerned, happiness is healthiness. </p>

                        <p>What could be happier than that magic combination of milk, cream, eggs, and cane sugar (or coconuts, cashews and oats for our vegan friends)? Yes, our ice cream has fat. And that’s okay. It’s good-good, not good-bad. </p>

                        <p>Good is choice ingredients. Even if we have to go to Mount Etna to get them. </p>

                        <p>Good is simple ingredients. If it’s tough to pronounce, it’s probably tough to digest. </p>

                        <p>Good is harmonious ingredients. We seek to satisfy omnivores and vegans alike. </p>

                        <p>This is our way. The good way. The Scoops! way. Not just the best way to make ice cream, but to live. </p>

                    </p>
